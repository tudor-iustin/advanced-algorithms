Problem name: Closest Pair of Points

The Closest Pair of Points issue asks to identify the two points in a 2-D plane
that are the closest to one another and determine their Euclidean distance.
The length of the section of a straight line that connects two points is known as
their Euclidean distance. By comparing each pair of points in the list and noting
the minimum distance, the problem can be solved brute force.

The size of the sequence is less than 100k and each value is between -1000000 and 1000000
